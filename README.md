# DIY-Battery-Monitor, Code coming soon...
Hi, this is the repository of my DIY- Battery Monitor Project shown on my YouTube Channel: Roland W
The Battery Monitor is setup for a Lithium Polymer Pack, but can be used for other chemistries as well.
Specific Voltage curves would have to be entered.
Logic: Voltage based prediction of SOC, corrected by Current measured on the Battery-Bus. Counting of real
Charging Cycles
Values displayed are:
- Total Pack Voltage
- Charge and Discharge Current
- SOC
- Actual Power on Battery
- Internet Connection
- 2 Temperature Probes
- Cycle Counter
- Millis Counter

WiFi and remote Monitoring using Blynk-App
